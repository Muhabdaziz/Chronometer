# Chronometer

In this project, I worked with simple embedded system: micro:bit card, to create a chronometer.
Here are the instructions to use this chronometer:

1. The button A launchs and stops the chronometer. When the chronometer is stopped, the time is scrolled on the screen. 
2. When the chrono is stopped, the button B allows to reset the chrono.
3. The button A allows to restart the chrono (without reseting it) and restop it.
4. The button B allows to give intermediate time when the chrono is runing.

To test the program without real microbit, use this link: https://create.withcode.uk/%C2%A0
